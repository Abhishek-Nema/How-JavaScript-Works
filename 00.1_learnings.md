- Why var doesn't get error while hoisting, but let and const gets Reference Error?
  -- bcoz when var is hosited then it gets initialized with undefined, but when let and const get hoisted then nothing gets initialized to them, puuting them in TDZ.

  - What accumulator does in reduce() method of array?
    -- it takes some initial value, although it's optional but if we don't provide it then the first element of array will become the accumulator value.

- Which sorting algorithm sort() method of array mostly use?
  -- quicksort algorithm

- Should we add "return" in catch block?
  -- Yes, as it prevents from bugs.

  example...

  ```JavaScript
  function divide(a, b) {
  try {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Can't divide by zero");
  }
  let result = a / b;
  console.log("Result is:", result);
  } catch (err) {
  console.log("Error:", err.message);
  return; // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è this stops the function here
  }

  console.log("After catch"); // üß® runs if you don‚Äôt return
  }
  ```

  Output: divide(10, 0);

  // Without return ‚Üí prints: Error..., then "After catch" ‚ùå
  // With return ‚Üí prints: Error..., and STOPS ‚úÖ
