// Reference Error (run time error): when js engine is not able to find or refer the variable in the scope.

// Syntax Error (compile time error): when code is not following the rules of programming

// const z;

// Type Error (run time error):  when you try to do something that the type doesnâ€™t support

// let : let can be hoisted but stays in TDZ until initialize. cannot re-declare "let" variable

// const : const can also be hoisted but stays in TDZ until declare + initialize. cannot re-declare and re-initialize "const" variable
